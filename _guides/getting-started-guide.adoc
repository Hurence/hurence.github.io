Learn how to create a Hello World Logisland app.
This guide covers:

* Bootstrapping an application
* Inject some logs
* Parse them
* Inspect the resulting events

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* a simple text editor
* docker & docker-compose installed and running

[NOTE]

If you does not have rights to execute docker with your current user you may need to add `sudo` to all docker commands.
You can look to the docker documentation to configure docker to works without sudo.


== Architecture

In this guide, we create a straightforward application parsing apache logs with a regex from `logisland_raw` topic and send structured events to `logisland_events`

image::logisland-stream-logs-parsing.png[alt=Architecture]

This guide also covers the testing kafka access .

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `conf/core/parse-apache-logs.yml` file.

If you decide to create the application yourself step by step please create a folder that we will call `logisland-quickstarts`
in this guide and go inside.


== Boostraping Logisland

Our app is pretty straightforward, it reads some raw apache log lines from a kafka topic, parse these lines as Logisland Records and send these records to another Kafka topic.

=== Configure the streaming app

The easiest way to create a new {project-name} is to open a text editor in the `./conf/core` folder and to edit a config file.
Edit the following content of `conf/core/parse-apache-logs.yml` in any text editor if you want to make some adjustments.

[source,yml,subs=attributes+]

----

An Engine is needed to handle the stream processing. This configuration file defines a stream processing job setup.
The first section configures the Spark engine (we will use a
https://logisland.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/components/engines/engine-spark.html#kafkastreamprocessingengine[KafkaStreamProcessingEngine])
to run in local mode with 2 cpu cores and 2G of RAM.

Inside this engine you will run a Kafka stream of processing, so we setup input/output topics and Kafka/Zookeeper hosts.
Here the stream will read all the logs sent in `logisland_raw` topic and push the processing output into `logisland_events` topic.

We can define some serializers to marshall all records from and to a topic.

== Setting up Underlyning services
Apache Kafka is pitched as a Distributed Streaming Platform. In Kafka lingo, Producers continuously generate data (streams) and Consumers are responsible for processing, storing and analysing it. Kafka Brokers are responsible for ensuring that in a distributed scenario the data can reach from Producers to Consumers without any inconsistency. A set of Kafka brokers and another piece of software called zookeeper constitute a typical Kafka deployment.

Let’s start with a single broker instance. In the `logisland-quickstarts` directory create your `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

[source,yml,subs=attributes+]
----
version: '3'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: wurstmeister/zookeeper
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
    networks:
      - logisland

  kafka:
    image: wurstmeister/kafka:0.10.2.1
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: kafka
      KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: "test:1:1"
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./data:/tmp/data
    networks:
      - logisland

  logisland:
    image: hurence/logisland:latest
    entrypoint: 
      - "tail"
      - "-f"
      - "bin/logisland.sh"
    ports:
      - '4050:4050'    
    volumes:
      - ./conf:/opt/logisland/conf
    environment:

  redis:
    hostname: redis
    image: 'redis:latest'
    ports:
      - '6379:6379'
    networks:
      - logisland

volumes:
  kafka-home:

networks:
  logisland:
----

Start Zookeeper, Kafka, Loggen & Logisland container with the following command `docker-compose up -d`

== Launch Logisland Application

If you chose to go from scratch you can create a `log4j.properties` file in the `./conf` folder so that the logisland job does not floods with logs.
In this case create this file with the following content :

[source,properties,subs=attributes+]
----
# Root logger option
log4j.rootLogger=INFO,stdout,rolling


# Direct log messages to a log file
log4j.appender.rolling=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.rolling.DatePattern='.'yyyy-MM-dd
log4j.appender.rolling.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.rolling.layout.conversionPattern=[%d] %p %m (%c)%n
log4j.appender.rolling.maxFileSize=50MB
log4j.appender.rolling.maxBackupIndex=5
log4j.appender.rolling.ImmediateFlush=true
log4j.appender.rolling.encoding=UTF-8

# Direct log messages to stdout
log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.Target=System.out
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p %c{1}:%L - %m%n

log4j.logger.org.apache.zookeeper=ERROR, stdout
log4j.logger.org.I0Itec.zkclient=ERROR, stdout
log4j.additivity.kafka.server=false
log4j.additivity.kafka.consumer.ZookeeperConsumerConnector=false


# Log levels
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark=WARN
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.scheduler=WARN
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.history=WARN
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.streaming=WARN
log4j.logger.org.spark-project.jetty=WARN
log4j.logger.org.eclipse.jetty.server=OFF
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn=DEBUG

log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.ipc.ProtobufRpcEngine=WARN
log4j.logger.parquet.hadoop=WARN
log4j.logger.org.apache.kafka=ERROR
log4j.logger.kafka=WARN
log4j.logger.org.elasticsearch=WARN

log4j.logger.com.hurence=DEBUG
log4j.logger.org.jinterop=WARN
----

Now you can run the job inside the logisland container

`docker exec -ti logisland-quickstarts_logisland_1 ./bin/logisland.sh --conf conf/core/parse-apache-logs.yml`

[NOTE]

If the parent folder of your docker-compose.yml is not logisland-quickstarts, the name of your container will be different.
You can check this with docker ps (check docker documentation for more info).

This will launch a Logisland Stream application waiting for data in a Kafka topic that will be automatically created. 

The last logs should be something like :

[source,sh]
----

== Log mining

Now that the plumbing is up and running we'll just see what happens.

=== Inject some Apache logs into Kafka

Logs are beeing sent to `logisland_raw` Kafka topic to simulate a log collection system. Nothing to do here as it is already done for you by the loggen container which generates random apache logs.

[Tip]
  You could send the first 4000 lines of NASA http access over July 1995 to LogIsland with kafka scripts (available in our logisland container) to `logisland_raw` Kafka topic with the following command :
  `docker exec -ti logisland-quickstarts_kafka_1 sh -c "cat /tmp/data/access.log | /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list kafka:9092 --topic logisland_raw"`

If you want to see what is flowing into `logisland_raw` topic, just run the following :

`docker exec -ti logisland-quickstarts_kafka_1 /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --topic logisland_raw`

It should something like 

[source,shell]
----
68.25.236.19 - - [19/Jun/2019:15:05:36 +0200] "GET /app/main/posts HTTP/1.0" 200 4989 "http://hunter-clark.org/main/faq.php" "Mozilla/5.0 ...

----


=== See what we have in return

Logisland handles the parsing of the log lines and structure them as Records before sending them to `logisland_events`. Those will be sent in another Kafka topic.

`docker exec -ti logisland-quickstarts_kafka_1 /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --topic logisland_events`


You should see the apache log events such as : 

[source,shell]
----
{
  "id" : "e80c7088-6676-4b56-9aaf-30cfbe1a4367",
  "type" : "apache_log",
  "creationDate" : 804571706000,
  "fields" : {
    "src_ip" : "166.79.67.111",
    "record_id" : "e80c7088-6676-4b56-9aaf-30cfbe1a4367",
    "http_method" : "GET",
    "record_value" : "166.79.67.111 - - [01/Jul/1995:00:08:26 -0400] \"GET /images/NASA-logosmall.gif HTTP/1.0\" 200 786",
    "http_query" : "/images/NASA-logosmall.gif",
    "bytes_out" : "786",
    "identd" : "-",
    "http_version" : "HTTP/1.0",
    "http_status" : "200",
    "record_time" : 804571706000,
    "user" : "-",
    "record_type" : "apache_log"
  }
}
----



== What's going on behing the scene

You should open the following url http://localhost:4050/streaming/ in your browser to get some metrics from spark streaming throughput.

image:logisland-getting-started.png[Spark Streaming]

The main metric here is the lag or scheduling delay, which one you want to be as low as possible (near zero) or at least no increasing constantly otherwise this would be a sign that you need to make your app scale, it can be by increasing the partitionning of Kafka topics and the number of cores that process simultaneously your data. This is a huge topic.

Another metric is processing time, which gives us some insights about the processing capabilities of our setup. This where the logisland scalabity can be viewed (add more kafka topics and spark processors and you'll see how you can handle a more intense workload)


== Stop the solution

Stop Zookeeper, Kafka, Loggen & Logisland container with the following command `docker-compose down`

== What's next?

This guide covered the creation of an application using Logisland.
However, there is much more.
We recommend continuing the journey with the link:event-aggregation-guide[event aggregation guide], where you learn about how to aggregate some metrics from your data.
