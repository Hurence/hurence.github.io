Learn how to test your Logisland Application.
This guide covers:

* avro schema validation
* event aggregation stream

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+
* The completed greeter application from the link:getting-started-guide[Getting Started Guide]


== Architecture

In this guide, we expand on the initial log parsing stream that was created as part of the Getting Started Guide.
We cover how to generate time window metrics on some http traffic (apache log records).


image::logisland-stream-event-aggregation.png[Archi]

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `event-aggregation` directory.

This guide assumes you already have the completed application from the `getting-started` directory.


== Logisland job setup

The logisland job for this tutorial is already packaged in the tar.gz assembly and you can find it here :

Our application will add a new stream to the previous one : the sql stream is a special one one use a link:../extensions/kafkarecordstreamsqlaggregator.html[KafkaRecordStreamSQLAggregator].
This stream defines input/output topics names as well as Serializers, avro schema.

TIP: The http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.7/spec.html[Avro schema] is set for the input topic and must be same as the avro schema of the output topic for the stream that
produces the records (please refer to link:getting-started-guide[Getting Started Guide])

----

The most important part of the `KafkaRecordStreamSQLAggregator` is its `sql.query` property which defines
a query to apply on the incoming records for the given time window.

The following SQL query will be applied on sliding window of 10" of records.

[source,sql,subs=attributes+]
----
SELECT count(*) AS connections_count, 
       avg(bytes_out) AS avg_bytes_out, 
       src_ip, 
       first(record_time) as record_time
FROM logisland_events
GROUP BY src_ip
ORDER BY connections_count DESC
LIMIT 20
----    


which will consider ``logisland_events`` topic as SQL table and create 20 output Record with the fields avg_bytes_out, src_ip & record_time.
the statement with record_time will ensure that the created Records will correspond to the effective input event time (not the actual time).

----

Here we will compute every x seconds, the top twenty `src_ip` for connections count.
The result of the query will be pushed into to `logisland_aggregations` topic as new `top_client_metrics` Record containing `connections_count` and `avg_bytes_out` fields.



== Launch the script
For this tutorial we will handle some apache logs with a splitText parser and send them to Elastiscearch
Connect a shell to your logisland container to launch the following streaming jobs.

`sudo docker exec -i -t logisland bin/logisland.sh --conf conf/event-aggregation.yml`

== See what we have in return

Logisland will handle the parsing of the log lines and structure them as Records. Those will be sent in another Kafka topic.

    sudo docker exec -ti logisland-getting-started_kafka_1 /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh  \\ 
        --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --topic logisland_agregations --from-beginning


You should see the apache log events such as :
