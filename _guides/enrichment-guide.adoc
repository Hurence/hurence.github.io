Learn how to add meta information from external source and using a cache
This guide covers:

* LRU cache definition
* User Agent parsing
* FQDN meta data retrieval

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+
* The completed greeter application from the link:getting-started-guide[Getting Started Guide]


== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

* Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].
* The solution is located in the `core` directory.

This guide assumes you already have the completed application from the `getting-started` guide.

== Apache logs Enrichment

In the following tutorial we'll drive you through the process of enriching Apache logs with LogIsland platform.

One of the first steps when treating web access logs is to extract information from the User-Agent header string, in order to be able to classify traffic.
The User-Agent string is part of the access logs from the web server (this is the last field in the example below).

Another step is to find the FQDN (full qualified domain name) from an ip address.

[source]
----
127.0.0.1 - frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 2326 
    "http://www.example.com/start.html" "Mozilla/4.08 [en] (Win98; I ;Nav)"
----

That string is packed with information from the visitor, when you know how to interpret it. However, the User-Agent string is not based on any standard, and it is not trivial to extract meaningful information from it.
LogIsland provides a processor, based on the http://github.com/nielsbasjes/yauaa[YAUAA library], that simplifies that treatement.

LogIsland provides a processor, based on https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html[InetAdress class from JDK 8], that use reverse Dns to determine FQDN from an IP.

[Tip]
This class find FQDN from ip using IN-ADDR.ARPA (or IP6.ARPA for ipv6). If it finds a domain name, it verifies that it matches back the same address ip in order to prevent against https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing[IP spoofing attack].
 If you want to return the ip anyway, you should implement a new plugin using another library as dnsjava for example or open an issue for asking this feature.


== Install required components

For this tutorial please make sure to already have installed required modules. If not you can just do it through the components.sh command line:

[source,shell]
----
bin/components.sh -i com.hurence.logisland:logisland-processor-elasticsearch:1.1.2
bin/components.sh -i com.hurence.logisland:logisland-service-elasticsearch_2_4_0-client:1.1.2
bin/components.sh -i com.hurence.logisland:logisland-processor-enrichment:1.1.2
bin/components.sh -i com.hurence.logisland:logisland-processor-useragent:1.1.2
----




== Analyze User-Agent

You can either apply the modifications from this section to the file *conf/index-apache-logs.yml* ot directly use the file *conf/enrich-apache-logs.yml* that already includes them.

The stream needs to be modified to ::

* modify the regex to add the referer and the User-Agent strings for the SplitText processor
* modify the Avro schema to include the new fields returned by the UserAgentProcessor
* include the processing of the User-Agent string after the parsing of the logs
* include the processor IpToFqdn after the ParserUserAgent
* include a cache service to use with IpToFqdn processor

The example below shows how to include all of the fields supported by the processor.

[tip]
It is possible to remove unwanted fields from both the processor configuration and the Avro schema

Once the configuration file is updated, LogIsland must be restarted with that new configuration file.

    bin/logisland.sh --conf <new_configuration_file>

== Inspect the logs

You've completed the enrichment of your logs using the User-Agent processor.
The logs are now loaded into elasticSearch, in the following form :

    curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/logisland.*/_search?pretty
