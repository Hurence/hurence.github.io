Learn how to test your Logisland Application.
This guide covers:

* blah balh
* blih blih

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+
* The completed greeter application from the link:getting-started-guide.html[Getting Started Guide]

== Architecture

In this guide, we expand on the initial test that was created as part of the Getting Started Guide.
We cover injection into tests and also how to test native executables.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `getting-started-testing` directory.

This guide assumes you already have the completed application from the `getting-started` directory.
